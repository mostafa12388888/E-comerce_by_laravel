I have successfully developed a multilingual and multivendor store system that offers a versatile platform for businesses. The administrator has the capability to add or delete languages using a Helper Function, ensuring a customizable and user-friendly experience. Additionally, vendors have the ability to view and manage their products, as well as locate their store through the integration of the Google Maps API.
